package Search_Backbone into a class
	providing public method to resolve raw image flows into centerlines
	use enum::stage to save current status, do output when detect ends or error occurs(in the deconstructor)
(doneï¼Œbut is 2.5 times slower after brought in inherit, the corresponding part is even 8 times slower, need black-tech instead)

black-tech
	void ptr + offset
(done)

decoupling Skeletonize and Candidate_Points
	move used-point-check
		thus remove the ugly State_Machine Owner_Marker, simply use array
		if Query_Points_By_Pointer find a used point, connect it to current and stop
(done)

add persistence of Centerline
add anti-persistence
(done)

use graph analyze to help find correct root(replace current Prune Method and Root_Search):	
	new method should generate a new graph:
		use array to mark the deleted vertex:		
			find largest subgraph
			edge search (adapt current one)
			prune (according following)
			if need deal with clockwise
			head select
		prune the new graph:
			algorithm according to my master thesis, use Graph Theory
	maintain a dynamic bifurcate-vertex-branch list
		init:
			find all bifurcate vertex
			follow each adjacent till meet a special vertex
		element in list include:
			this vertex
			one adjacent vertex
			leaf-vertex/bifurcate-vertex connected to this bifurcate-vertex through the adjacent vertex
			path-length
		if leaf branch deleted:
			delete the corresponding element if degree==2
		if bifurcate branch deleted:
			delete the two corresponding element if degree==2
(done)

decoupling Skeletonize and Graph
	move Calc_End_Direction_Vec

wrap json interface(jsoncpp?)

add cross-check into Skeletonize
	use center-point and hash-list to accelerate	(segment tree?)
	sort in-time | maintain a stack
	use cross-product to judge cross-status:
		[(a2-a1)\times(b2-a2)] \dot [(b1-a2)\times(b2-a2)] > 0
		and
		[(a1-a2)\times(b1-a1)] \dot [(b2-a1)\times(b1-a1)] > 0
	
	2 line split into 4 when cross checked
	if length<sqrt(2) after split, remove
